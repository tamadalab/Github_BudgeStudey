A robust, all-in-one GPT interface for Discord. Chat just like ChatGPT right inside Discord! Generate beautiful AI art using DALL-E 2! Automatically moderate your server using AI! Upload documents, videos, and files to get AI-assisted insights! A thorough integration with permanent conversation memory powered by [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), automatic request retry, fault tolerance and reliability for servers of any scale, and much more.  
- **Multi-modality** - GPTDiscord now supports images sent to the bot during a conversation made with `/gpt converse`!
- **Internet-connected Chat!** - Chat with an instance of GPT3.5 or GPT-4 that's connected to google and wolfram alpha and can browse and access links that you send it!
- **Have long term, permanent conversations with the bot, just like chatgpt, with `/gpt converse`** - Conversations happen in threads that get automatically cleaned up!  
- **Custom Indexes** - Use your own files, pdfs, txt files, websites, discord channel content as context when asking GPT questions!  
- **AI-Assisted Google Search** - Speaks for itself!  
- **DALL-E Image Generation** - Generate DALL-E AI images right in discord with `/dalle draw <prompt>`! It even supports multiple image qualities, multiple images, creating image variants, retrying, and saving images.  
- **DALL-E Image Prompt Optimization** - Given some text that you're trying to generate an image for, the bot will automatically optimize the text to be more DALL-E friendly! `/dalle optimize <prompt>`  
- **Redo Requests** - A simple button after the GPT response or DALL-E generation allows you to redo the initial prompt you asked. You can also redo conversation messages by just editing your message!  
- **Automatic AI-Based Server Moderation** - Moderate your server automatically with AI!  
- **Auto-retry on API errors** - Automatically resend failed requests to OpenAI's APIs!  
- Automatically re-send your prompt and update the response in place if you edit your original prompt!  
- Tag your bot in chat and it'll respond!  
- Async and fault tolerant, **can handle hundreds of users at once**, if the upstream API permits!  
`/gpt converse <opener> <opener_file> <private> <minimal>` - Start a conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT. Also use the option `use_threads:False` to start a conversation in a full discord channel!
`/internet search:<prompt> scope:<number of sites to visit> nodes:<how deep gpt should think>` - Search the internet with GPT assistance!
`/index add file:<file> or link:<link>` - Use a document or use a link to create/add to your indexes. If you provide a youtube link, the transcript of the video will be used. If you provide a web url, the contents of the webpage will be used, if you provide an image, the image text will be extracted and used!
