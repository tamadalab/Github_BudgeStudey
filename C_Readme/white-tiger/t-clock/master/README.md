**T-Clock Redux** is an enhanced fork of [Stoic Joker's T-Clock 2010](http://www.stoicjoker.com/TClock/)  
with ISO week number support, bug fixes and the ability to use Windows' default calendar and tooltips.

T-Clock *(called TClock)*, originally written by Kazubon in the early 90's, was a popular classic that was on the edge of extinction when Windows started going 64bit. ... Stoic Joker simply chose not to let that happen. And now it's up to us to continue their efforts.

### Requirements
* Windows 2000+ *(up to Windows 10 as of 2014)*

### What's that `_vc2010` build?
* As of 2018, all new releases will be build with GCC instead of the Visual C++ 2010 compiler.
  So the previously known `_static` builds are used instead and for compatibility reasons,
  `_vc2010` archives will still use the old compiler and are meant for advanced users.
* Requires: [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable](http://microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999) (install **both** 32bit `vcredist_x86` +  64bit `vcredist_x64` **on 64bit** OS)

### Support
* [Forum](http://donationcoder.com/forum/?board=324)
* [Issue Tracker](//github.com/White-Tiger/T-Clock/issues)
* or via email from T-Clock's about screen *(just click on it)*

### License
* GPLv2 ? *(license is currently unknown, needs further research)*
