## Building DeaDBeeF from source

### Linux, BSD and similar (GTK/*NIX version)

* See the README file for detailed instructions, dependencies, etc.
* Install git, Clang toolchain
* Remember to get submodules: `git submodule update --init`
* Install dependencies, as listed in the README file
* Run `./autogen.sh` to bootstrap
* Run `CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure`, followed with `make` and `sudo make install`.
* For more information about the build process, read the generated INSTALL file and the output of `./configure --help`.

### macOS

* Install Xcode. The latest one is the best, but older versions will usually keep working for a year or two.
* Run `sudo xcode-select --install` - This will configure git and command line build tools
* Clone the deadbeef git repository
* Remember to get submodules: ```git submodule update --init```

#### Command line

* Run ```xcodebuild -project osx/deadbeef.xcodeproj -target DeaDBeeF -configuration Release```
* The output will be located here: ```osx/build/Release/DeaDBeeF.app```

#### Xcode UI

* Open the `osx/deadbeef.xcodeproj` in Xcode, and build/run from there

### Windows

#### Prerequisites

* MSYS2: Install the 64-bit version of [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) and ensure to run `pacman -Syu`
* Premake5: [v5.0.0-beta1](https://premake.github.io/download)
* Toolchain
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libzip mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-dlfcn mingw-w64-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-x86_64-libblocksruntime git make tar xz
```
* Dependencies:
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-jansson mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk2 mingw-w64-x86_64-mpg123 mingw-w64-x86_64-flac mingw-w64-x86_64-portaudio
```
* Plugin dependencies: follow the [Windows plugin status page ](https://github.com/DeaDBeeF-Player/deadbeef/wiki/Windows-plugin-status) to find out dependencies of the plugins, and install them too.

#### Compiling

* Ensure that you are in mingw64 shell (run mingw64.exe) and clone this git
  repository
* From deadbeef main directory run `premake5 --standard gmake2` using your corresponding path to `premake5.exe`
* Compile with `make config=debug_windows` (debug build) or `make config=release_windows` (stripped/release build)
* Find the resulting binaries in `bin/debug` or `bin/release`

#### Other notes

* GTK3 uses [Windows-10](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10) theme and [Windows-10-Icons](https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-10) by default. If they are not in msys2 tree, then they must be manually placed in the `share/icons` and `share/themes`. A different theme can be specified by editing the `etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` file.
