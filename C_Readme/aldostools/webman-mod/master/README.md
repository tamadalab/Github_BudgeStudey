# webMAN MOD - Fork of original webMAN plugin by Deank for Playstation 3

__README IS STILL IN PROGRESS, IF YOU SEE ANY ERROR PLEASE TELL ME OR PUSH A COMMIT__

webMAN MOD is a homebrew plugin for PlayStation®3 forked from the original webMAN/sMAN by DeanK
with many features added.

The application provides extended services for PS3 console like web server, ftp server, file manager,
netiso, ntfs, gamepad emulation, ps3mapi, tasks automation, memory debugger and more.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aldostools/webMAN-MOD/master/README.png" width="800">

Our goal is to create an AIO plugin that includes many of the features available on the PS3 Scene
in an easy and intuitive way. webMAN MOD is the result of the hard work of several users, developers
and artists that collaborated with development, knowledge, resources, feedback & ideas.
