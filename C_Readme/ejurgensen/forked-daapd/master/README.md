# OwnTone (previously forked-daapd)

OwnTone is a Linux/FreeBSD DAAP (iTunes), MPD (Music Player Daemon) and
RSP (Roku) media server.

It supports AirPlay devices/speakers, Apple Remote (and compatibles),
MPD clients, Chromecast, network streaming, internet radio, Spotify and LastFM.

It does not support streaming video by AirPlay nor Chromecast.

DAAP stands for Digital Audio Access Protocol which is the protocol used
by iTunes and friends to share/stream media libraries over the network.

OwnTone was previously called forked-daapd, which again was a rewrite of
mt-daapd (Firefly Media Server).
