Way Cooler is the compositor component of [AwesomeWM][] for [Wayland][]. 

## Building

To build Way Cooler, ensure you have meson installed 
(as well as [wlroots][], or use the `subprojects/` directory 
and build it locally).

Then, execute:

```bash
meson build
ninja -C build
```

To run the compositor simply execute `build/way-cooler/way-cooler` in a TTY or
any existing window manager.

It can run with [this patched version of the Awesome
client](https://github.com/way-cooler/awesome). The simplest way to execute both
is to run `way-cooler -c </path/to/patched/awesome>`.

Though technically they can run standalone, the compositor is not usable by
itself and the client will fail out in other compositor due to the custom
protocols not being present.

## Development

Way Cooler is under active development. If you would like to contribute you can
contact me best on [IRC][] (I also hang out on freenode).

**Master is not usable for production**. There are old versions of Way Cooler
that do work, however:

* Is written in Rust and must be built with `cargo`.
* They use an old framework, [wlc][], and thus are very limited and buggy.
* Was not designed to emulate Awesome, but instead has [i3][] tiling and its own
  (very incomplete) Lua libraries.
