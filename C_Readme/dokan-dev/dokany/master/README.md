## What is Dokan
When you want to create a new file system on Windows, other than FAT or NTFS,
you need to develop a file system driver. Developing a device driver that works
in kernel mode on windows is extremely technical. By using Dokan, you can create
your own file systems very easily without writing device drivers. Dokan is
similar to FUSE (Linux file system in user space) but works on Windows. Moreover,
dokany includes a [FUSE wrapper](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/wiki/FUSE)
that helps you to port your FUSE filesystems without changes.

## What is Dokany
*Dokany is a fork of Dokan 0.6.0 with bug fixes, clean change history and
updated to build with latest tools.*

Because the original Dokan Legacy (< 0.6.0) project is no longer maintained.

Since version 0.8.0, dokany broke compatibility with the dokan API. See
[Choose a version](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/wiki/Installation#choose-a-version)
for more information.

The API has then again changed over time in [1.1.0](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/wiki/Update-Dokan-1.0.0-application-to-Dokany-1.1.0) and [2.0.0](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/wiki/Update-Dokan-1.1.0-application-to-Dokany-2.0.0).

## Benchmark v1.5.1.1000 vs v2.0.3.1000
A benchmark that is testing multiple scenarios repeaditly and sequentially was run 5 times against the `memfs` sample of v1.5.1.1000 and v2.0.3.1000 in an idle environment to precise results.
The detail results can be seen in this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zdJ6fmP_sqUGCM7SLtTle9N3JLyBOEAMRlwDLfUqm4Q/edit?usp=sharing).
As better threading and memory poll were added in v2, it is expected that concurrent scenarios (like those tests) would be even more highly improved.

A sample of the results:
```
Create New      |  +13.55% | List          |  +60.69% | GetAttributes |  +48.78% | Read  | +18-42% |
Open/Overwrite  | +153.41% | ListExactFile | +131.91% | SetAttributes | +120.91% | Write | +10-32% |
RandomOpenClose | +173.05% |               |          | Delete        |  +90.83% |       |         |
```

## Environment
Dokan works on
 * Windows Server 2022 / 2019 / 2016 / 2012 (R2) / 2008 R2 SP1
 * Windows 11 / 10 / 8.1 / 8 / 7 SP1
 
Platform
 * x86
 * x64
 * ARM
 * ARM64

**Signed Release and Debug drivers** are provided at each release for all platforms.

## How it works
Dokan library contains a user mode DLL (dokan2.dll) and a kernel mode file
system driver (dokan2.sys). Once the Dokan file system driver is installed, you can
create file systems which can be seen as normal file systems in Windows. The
application that creates file systems using Dokan library is called File system
application.

File operation requests from user programs (e.g., CreateFile, ReadFile,
WriteFile, ...) will be sent to the Windows I/O subsystem (runs in kernel mode)
which will subsequently forward the requests to the Dokan file system driver
(dokan2.sys). By using functions provided by the Dokan user mode library
(dokan2.dll), file system applications are able to register callback functions
to the file system driver. The file system driver will invoke these callback
routines in order to respond to the requests it received. The results of the
callback routines will be sent back to the user program.

For example, when Windows Explorer requests to open a directory, the CreateFile
with Direction option request will be sent to Dokan file system driver and the
driver will invoke the CreateFile callback provided by the file system
application. The results of this routine are sent back to Windows Explorer as
the response to the CreateFile request. Therefore, the Dokan file system driver
acts as a proxy between user programs and file system applications. The
advantage of this approach is that it allows programmers to develop file systems
in user mode which is safe and easy to debug.
