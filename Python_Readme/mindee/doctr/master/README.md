**Optical Character Recognition made seamless & accessible to anyone, powered by TensorFlow 2 & PyTorch**


What you can expect from this repository:
- efficient ways to parse textual information (localize and identify each word) from your documents
- guidance on how to integrate this in your current architecture

![OCR_example](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.2.0/ocr.png)

## Quick Tour

### Getting your pretrained model

End-to-End OCR is achieved in docTR using a two-stage approach: text detection (localizing words), then text recognition (identify all characters in the word).
As such, you can select the architecture used for [text detection](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest/modules/models.html#doctr-models-detection), and the one for [text recognition](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest//modules/models.html#doctr-models-recognition) from the list of available implementations.

```python
from doctr.models import ocr_predictor

model = ocr_predictor(det_arch='db_resnet50', reco_arch='crnn_vgg16_bn', pretrained=True)
```

### Reading files

Documents can be interpreted from PDF or images:

```python
from doctr.io import DocumentFile
# PDF
pdf_doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf")
# Image
single_img_doc = DocumentFile.from_images("path/to/your/img.jpg")
# Webpage
webpage_doc = DocumentFile.from_url("https://www.yoursite.com")
# Multiple page images
multi_img_doc = DocumentFile.from_images(["path/to/page1.jpg", "path/to/page2.jpg"])
```

### Putting it together
Let's use the default pretrained model for an example:
```python
from doctr.io import DocumentFile
from doctr.models import ocr_predictor

model = ocr_predictor(pretrained=True)
# PDF
doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf")
# Analyze
result = model(doc)
```

### Dealing with rotated documents
Should you use docTR on documents that include rotated pages, or pages with multiple box orientations,
you have multiple options to handle it:

- If you only use straight document pages with straight words (horizontal, same reading direction),
consider passing `assume_straight_boxes=True` to the ocr_predictor. It will directly fit straight boxes
on your page and return straight boxes, which makes it the fastest option.

- If you want the predictor to output straight boxes (no matter the orientation of your pages, the final localizations
will be converted to straight boxes), you need to pass `export_as_straight_boxes=True` in the predictor. Otherwise, if `assume_straight_pages=False`, it will return rotated bounding boxes (potentially with an angle of 0Â°).

If both options are set to False, the predictor will always fit and return rotated boxes.


To interpret your model's predictions, you can visualize them interactively as follows:

```python
result.show(doc)
```

![Visualization sample](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.1.1/doctr_example_script.gif)

Or even rebuild the original document from its predictions:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

synthetic_pages = result.synthesize()
plt.imshow(synthetic_pages[0]); plt.axis('off'); plt.show()
```

![Synthesis sample](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.3.1/synthesized_sample.png)


The `ocr_predictor` returns a `Document` object with a nested structure (with `Page`, `Block`, `Line`, `Word`, `Artefact`).
To get a better understanding of our document model, check our [documentation](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/modules/io.html#document-structure):

You can also export them as a nested dict, more appropriate for JSON format:

```python
json_output = result.export()
```

### Use the KIE predictor
The KIE predictor is a more flexible predictor compared to OCR as your detection model can detect multiple classes in a document. For example, you can have a detection model to detect just dates and adresses in a document.

The KIE predictor makes it possible to use detector with multiple classes with a recognition model and to have the whole pipeline already setup for you.

```python
from doctr.io import DocumentFile
from doctr.models import kie_predictor

# Model
model = kie_predictor(det_arch='db_resnet50', reco_arch='crnn_vgg16_bn', pretrained=True)
# PDF
doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf")
# Analyze
result = model(doc)

predictions = result.pages[0].predictions
for class_name in predictions.keys():
    list_predictions = predictions[class_name]
    for prediction in list_predictions:
        print(f"Prediction for {class_name}: {prediction}")
```
The KIE predictor results per page are in a dictionary format with each key representing a class name and it's value are the predictions for that class.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are required to install docTR.

Since we use [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/), you will need extra dependencies if you are not running Linux.

For MacOS users, you can install them as follows:
```shell
brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi
```

For Windows users, those dependencies are included in GTK. You can find the latest installer over [here](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases).

### Latest release

You can then install the latest release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/python-doctr/) as follows:

```shell
pip install python-doctr
```
> :warning: Please note that the basic installation is not standalone, as it does not provide a deep learning framework, which is required for the package to run.

We try to keep framework-specific dependencies to a minimum. You can install framework-specific builds as follows:

```shell
# for TensorFlow
pip install "python-doctr[tf]"
# for PyTorch
pip install "python-doctr[torch]"
```

For MacBooks with M1 chip, you will need some additional packages or specific versions:

- TensorFlow 2: [metal plugin](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/)
- PyTorch: [version >= 1.12.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally)

### Developer mode
Alternatively, you can install it from source, which will require you to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
First clone the project repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mindee/doctr.git
pip install -e doctr/.
```

Again, if you prefer to avoid the risk of missing dependencies, you can install the TensorFlow or the PyTorch build:
```shell
# for TensorFlow
pip install -e doctr/.[tf]
# for PyTorch
pip install -e doctr/.[torch]
```

```shell
PORT=8002 docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### What you have deployed

Your API should now be running locally on your port 8002. Access your automatically-built documentation at [http://localhost:8002/redoc](http://localhost:8002/redoc) and enjoy your three functional routes ("/detection", "/recognition", "/ocr", "/kie"). Here is an example with Python to send a request to the OCR route:

```python
import requests
with open('/path/to/your/doc.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/ocr", files={'file': data}).json()
```
