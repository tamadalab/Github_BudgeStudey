[![Updates](https://pyup.io/repos/github/pyupio/safety/shield.svg)](https://pyup.io/repos/github/pyupio/safety/)

Safety checks Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and suggests the proper remediations for vulnerabilities detected. Safety can be run on developer machines, in CI/CD pipelines and on production systems.

By default it uses the open Python vulnerability database [Safety DB](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db), which is **licensed for non-commercial use only**.

For all commercial projects, Safely must be upgraded to use a [PyUp API](https://pyup.io) using the `--key` option.

# Supported and Tested Python Versions

Python: `3.6`, `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`

Safety supports the above versions but only is tested in the latest patch version available at [Python for Actions
](https://github.com/actions/python-versions/blob/main/versions-manifest.json). For instance, in Python `3.6` we only will test with `3.6.15`, which is the latest Python 3.6 version available on GitHub actions.

Make sure to use the latest patch available for your Python version.

# Using Safety as a GitHub Action

Safety can be integrated into your existing GitHub CI pipeline as an action. Just add the following as a step in your workflow YAML file after setting your `SAFETY_API_KEY` secret on GitHub under Settings -> Secrets -> Actions:

```yaml
      - uses: pyupio/safety@2.3.5
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.SAFETY_API_KEY }}
```

(Don't have an API Key? You can sign up for one with [PyUp](https://pyup.io).)

This will run Safety in auto-detect mode which figures out your project's structure and the best configuration to run in automatically. It'll fail your CI pipeline if any vulnerable packages are found.

If you have something more complicated such as a monorepo; or once you're finished testing, read the [Action Documentation](https://docs.pyup.io/docs/github-actions-safety) for more details on configuring Safety as an action.

# Installation

Install `safety` with pip. Keep in mind that we support only Python 3.6 and up.

```bash
pip install safety
```

# Documentation

For detailed documentation, please see [Safety's documentation portal](https://docs.pyup.io/docs/getting-started-with-safety-cli).

# Basic Usage

To check your currently selected virtual environment for dependencies with known security
 vulnerabilities, run:

```bash
safety check
```

You should get a report similar to this:
```bash
+=================================================================================+

                               /$$$$$$            /$$

## Starter documentation

### Configuring the target of the scan
Safety can scan requirements.txt files, the local environment as well as direct input piped into Safety.

To scan a requirements file:

```bash
safety check -r requirements.txt
```

To scan the local environment:

```bash
safety check
```

Safety is also able to read from stdin with the `--stdin` flag set.
```
cat requirements.txt | safety check --stdin
```

or the output of `pip freeze`:
```
pip freeze | safety check --stdin
```

or to check a single package:
```
echo "insecure-package==0.1" | safety check --stdin
```

*For more examples, take a look at the [options](#options) section.*


### Specifying the output format of the scan

Safety can output the scan results in a variety of formats and outputs. This includes: screen, text, JSON, and bare outputs. Using the ```--output``` flag to configure this output. The default output is to the screen.

```--output json``` will output JSON for further processing and analysis.
```--output text``` can be used to save the scan to file to later auditing.
```--output bare``` simply prints out the packages that have known vulnerabilities

### Exit codes

Safety by default emits exit codes based on the result of the code, allowing you to run safety inside of CI/CD processes. If no vulnerabilities were found the exit code will be 0. In cases of a vulnerability being found, non-zero exit codes will be returned.

### Scan a Python-based Docker image

To scan a docker image `IMAGE_TAG`, you can run

```console
docker run -it --rm ${IMAGE_TAG} /bin/bash -c "pip install safety && safety check"
```

## Using Safety in Docker

Safety can be easily executed as Docker container. It can be used just as
described in the [examples](#examples) section.

```console
echo "insecure-package==0.1" | docker run -i --rm pyupio/safety safety check --stdin
cat requirements.txt | docker run -i --rm pyupio/safety safety check --stdin
```

## Using the Safety binaries

The Safety [binaries](https://github.com/pyupio/safety/releases) provide some
[extra security](https://pyup.io/posts/patched-vulnerability/).

After installation, they can be used just like the regular command line version
of Safety.

## Using Safety with a CI service

Safety works great in your CI pipeline. It returns by default meaningful non-zero exit codes:


| CODE NAME      | MEANING     | VALUE  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| EXIT_CODE_OK                    | Successful scan  | 0 |
| EXIT_CODE_FAILURE               | An unexpected issue happened, please run the debug mode and write to us      |   1 |
| EXIT_CODE_VULNERABILITIES_FOUND | Safety found vulnerabilities      |    64 |
| EXIT_CODE_INVALID_API_KEY       | The API KEY used is invalid | 65 |
| EXIT_CODE_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS     | You are making too many request, please wait around 40 seconds | 66 |
| EXIT_CODE_UNABLE_TO_LOAD_LOCAL_VULNERABILITY_DB | The local vulnerability database is malformed | 67 |
| EXIT_CODE_UNABLE_TO_FETCH_VULNERABILITY_DB | Client network or server issues trying to fetch the database | 68 |
| EXIT_CODE_MALFORMED_DB | The fetched vulnerability database is malformed or in the review command case, the report to review is malformed | 69 |

if you want Safety continues on error (always return zero exit code), you can use `--continue-on-error` flag

Run it before or after your tests. If Safety finds something, your tests will fail.

**Travis CI**
```yaml
install:
  - pip install safety

script:
  - safety check
```

**Gitlab CI**
```yaml
safety:
  script:
    - pip install safety
    - safety check
```

**Tox**
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py37

[testenv]
deps =
    safety
    pytest
commands =
    safety check
    pytest
```

**Deep GitHub Integration**

If you are looking for a deep integration with your GitHub repositories: Safety is available as a
part of [pyup.io](https://pyup.io/), called [Safety CI](https://pyup.io/safety/ci/). Safety CI
checks your commits and pull requests for dependencies with known security vulnerabilities
and displays a status on GitHub.

# Using Safety in production

Safety is free and open source (MIT Licensed). The data it relies on from the free Safety-db database is license for non-commercial use only, is limited and only updated once per month.

**All commercial projects and teams must sign up for a paid plan at [PyUp.io](https://pyup.io)**

## Options

### `--key`

*API Key for pyup.io's vulnerability database. This can also be set as `SAFETY_API_KEY` environment variable.*

**Example**
```bash
safety check --key=12345-ABCDEFGH
```

___

### `--db`

*Path to a directory with a local vulnerability database including `insecure.json` and `insecure_full.json`*

**Example**
```bash
safety check --db=/home/safety-db/data
```

### `--proxy-host`

# Python 2.7

This tool requires latest Python patch versions starting with version 3.6. We
did support Python 2.7 in the past but, as for other Python 3.x minor versions,
it reached its End-Of-Life and as such we are not able to support it anymore.

We understand you might still have Python < 3.6 projects running. At the same
time, Safety itself has a commitment to encourage developers to keep their
software up-to-date, and it would not make sense for us to work with officially
unsupported Python versions, or even those that reached their end of life.

If you still need to run Safety from a Python 2.7 environment, please use
version 1.8.7 available at PyPi. Alternatively, you can run Safety from a
Python 3 environment to check the requirements file for your Python 2.7
project.
