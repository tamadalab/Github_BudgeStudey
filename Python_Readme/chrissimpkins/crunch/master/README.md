## About

Crunch is a tool for lossy PNG image file optimization.  It combines selective bit depth, color type, and color palette reduction with zopfli DEFLATE compression algorithm encoding using the pngquant and zopflipng PNG optimization tools.  This approach leads to a significant file size gain relative to lossless approaches at the expense of a relatively modest decrease in image quality (see [example images](#examples) below).

[Continuous benchmark testing](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/actions/workflows/crunch-bench.yml) is available in our GitHub Actions CI. Please see the benchmarks directory of this repository for details about the benchmarking approach and instructions on how to execute benchmarks locally on the reference images distributed in this repository or with your own image files.

Crunch PNG image optimization is available through the following applications that are distributed in this repository:

- [`crunch`](docs/EXECUTABLE.md) - a *nix command line executable that can be used on macOS, Linux, and Windows POSIX application deployment environments such as Cygwin or the Windows subsystem for Linux
- [Crunch GUI](docs/MACOSGUI.md) - a native macOS drag and drop GUI tool
- [Crunch Image(s)](docs/SERVICE.md) service - a macOS right-click menu service for PNG images selected in the Finder

## Installation and Usage

Installation and usage documentation links for each of the Crunch applications are available below.

## `crunch` Command Line Executable

The `crunch` command line executable can be installed with `make` or manually.  Please see the [Install documentation](docs/EXECUTABLE.md#install).

Enter paths to your PNG image files as arguments to the `crunch` executable.  Please see the [Usage documentation](docs/EXECUTABLE.md#usage).

## Crunch macOS GUI Application

The Crunch native macOS GUI application can be installed with Homebrew or the dmg installer that can be downloaded from the [repository releases](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Crunch/releases/latest).  Please see the [Install documentation](docs/MACOSGUI.md#install).

Drag and drop one or more images on the application window to process your PNG files.  Please see the [Usage documentation](docs/MACOSGUI.md#usage).

## Crunch Image(s) macOS Right-Click Menu Service

The macOS right-click menu service "Crunch Image(s)" can be installed with `make` or manually by drag and drop in the macOS Finder. Please see the [Install documentation](docs/SERVICE.md).

Select one or more PNG images in the Finder, right-click, and select the `Services > Crunch Image(s)` menu item to process your files.  Please see the [Usage documentation](docs/SERVICE.md).

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the benefits and disadvantages of the current iteration of Crunch's aggressive space saving optimization strategy.  The optimized image files are updated at every Crunch release.  In many cases, the PNG optimization decreases file size with an imperceptible impact on image quality.  In some cases, degradation of image quality is visible. Visual confirmation of image quality is highly recommended with lossy optimization tools in production settings.
