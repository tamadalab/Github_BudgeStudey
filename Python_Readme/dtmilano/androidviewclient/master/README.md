**AndroidViewClient** was originally conceived as an extension to [monkeyrunner](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkeyrunner_concepts.html) but lately evolved
as a pure python tool that automates or simplifies test script creation.
It is a test framework for Android applications that:
<ul><ul>
    <li>Automates driving Android applications</li>
    <li>Generates re-usable scripts</li>
    <li>Provides view-based <i>device independent</i> UI interaction</li>
    <li>Uses 'logical' screen comparison (UI Automator Hierarchy based) over image comparison (Avoiding extraneous 
    detail issues, such as time or data changes)</li>
    <li>Supports running concurrently on multiple devices</li>
    <li>Provides simple control for high level operations like language change and activity start</li>
    <li>Supports all Android APIs</li>
    <li>Is written in python (python 3.6+ support in 20.x.y+)</li>
</ul></ul>

**ðŸ›Ž** |A new Kotlin backend is under development to provide more functionality and improve performance.<br>Take a look at [CulebraTester2](https://github.com/dtmilano/CulebraTester2-public) and 20.x.y-series prerelease. |
