## What is Kedro?

Kedro is a toolbox for production-ready data science. It uses software engineering best practices to help you create data engineering and data science pipelines that are reproducible, maintainable, and modular.

Kedro is an open-source Python framework hosted by the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/).

## How do I install Kedro?

To install Kedro from the Python Package Index (PyPI) run:

```
pip install kedro
```

It is also possible to install Kedro using `conda`:

```
conda install -c conda-forge kedro
```

Our [Get Started guide](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/get_started/install.html) contains full installation instructions, and includes how to set up Python virtual environments.

## How do I use Kedro?

The [Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/) first explains [how to install Kedro](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/get_started/install.html) and then introduces [key Kedro concepts](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/get_started/kedro_concepts.html).

- The first example illustrates the [basics of a Kedro project](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/get_started/new_project.html) using the Iris dataset
- You can then review the [spaceflights tutorial](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial_template.html) to build a Kedro project for hands-on experience

For new and intermediate Kedro users, there's a comprehensive section on [how to visualise Kedro projects using Kedro-Viz](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/visualisation/kedro-viz_visualisation.html) and [how to work with Kedro and Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/notebooks_and_ipython/kedro_and_notebooks).

Further documentation is available for more advanced Kedro usage and deployment. We also recommend the [glossary](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/resources/glossary.html) and the [API reference documentation](/kedro) for additional information.

## Why does Kedro exist?

Kedro is built upon our collective best-practice (and mistakes) trying to deliver real-world ML applications that have vast amounts of raw unvetted data. We developed Kedro to achieve the following:

- To address the main shortcomings of Jupyter notebooks, one-off scripts, and glue-code because there is a focus on
  creating **maintainable data science code**
- To enhance **team collaboration** when different team members have varied exposure to software engineering concepts
- To increase efficiency, because applied concepts like modularity and separation of concerns inspire the creation of
  **reusable analytics code**

## The humans behind Kedro

The [Kedro product team](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/contribution/technical_steering_committee.html#kedro-maintainers) and a number of [open source contributors from across the world](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/releases) maintain Kedro.
