## What is new?

Please check the [ChangeLog](CHANGELOG.md) file for the detailed information.

DeepDiff 6-3-0

- [`PrefixOrSuffixOperator`](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/custom.html#prefix-or-suffix-operator-label): This operator will skip strings that are suffix or prefix of each other.
- [`include_obj_callback`](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/ignore_types_or_values.html#include-obj-callback-label) and `include_obj_callback_strict` are added by [HÃ¥vard Thom](https://github.com/havardthom).
- Fixed a corner case where numpy's `np.float32` nans are not ignored when using `ignore_nan_equality` by [Noam Gottlieb](https://github.com/noamgot)
- `orjson` becomes optional again.
- Fix for `ignore_type_in_groups` with numeric values so it does not report number changes when the number types are different.

DeepDiff 6-2-0

- Major improvement in the diff report for lists when items are all hashable and the order of items is important.

# Contribute

1. Please make your PR against the dev branch
2. Please make sure that your PR has tests. Since DeepDiff is used in many sensitive data driven projects, we strive to maintain around 100% test coverage on the code.

Please run `pytest --cov=deepdiff --runslow` to see the coverage report. Note that the `--runslow` flag will run some slow tests too. In most cases you only want to run the fast tests which so you wont add the `--runslow` flag.

Or to see a more user friendly version, please run: `pytest --cov=deepdiff --cov-report term-missing --runslow`.

Thank you!
