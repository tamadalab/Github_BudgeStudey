`piku`, inspired by [dokku][dokku], allows you do `git push` deployments to your own servers, no matter how small they are.

## Project Activity

**`piku` is considered STABLE**. It is actively maintained, but "actively" here means the feature set is pretty much done, so it is only updated when new language runtimes are added or reproducible bugs crop up.

It is currently being refactored to require Python 3.7 or above, since even though 3.8+ is now the baseline Python 3 version in Ubuntu LTS 20.04 and Debian 11 has already moved on to 3.9, there are no substantial differences between those versions.

## Deprecation Notices

Since most of its users run it on LTS distributions, there is no rush to introduce disruption. The current plan is to throw up a warning for older runtimes and do regression testing for 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 (replacing the current bracket of tests from 3.5 to 3.8), and make sure we also cover Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 11 and Fedora 37+.

## Goals and Motivation

I kept finding myself wanting an Heroku/CloudFoundry-like way to deploy stuff on a few ARM boards and [my Raspberry Pi cluster][raspi-cluster], but since [dokku][dokku] didn't work on ARM at the time and even `docker` can be overkill sometimes, I decided to roll my own.

`piku` is currently able to deploy, manage and independently scale multiple applications per host on both ARM and Intel architectures, and works on any cloud provider (as well as bare metal) that can run Python, `nginx` and `uwsgi`.

### Core values

 * Must run on low end devices.
 * Accessible to hobbyists and K-12 schools.
 * ~1500 lines readable code.
 * Functional code style.
 * Few (single?) dependencies
 * [12 factor app](https://12factor.net).
 * Simplify user experience.
 * Cover 80% of common use cases.
 * Sensible defaults for all features.
 * Leverage distro packages in Raspbian/Debian/Ubuntu (Alpine and RHEL support is WIP)
 * Leverage standard tooling (`git`, `ssh`, `uwsgi`, `nginx`).
 * Preserve backwards compatibility where possible

## Using `piku`

`piku` supports a Heroku-like workflow:

* Create a `git` SSH remote pointing to your `piku` server with the app name as repo name:
  `git remote add piku piku@yourserver:appname`.
* Push your code: `git push piku master` (or if you want to push a different branch than the current one use `git push piku release-branch-name`).
* `piku` determines the runtime and installs the dependencies for your app (building whatever's required).
   * For Python, it segregates each app's dependencies into a `virtualenv`.
   * For Go, it defines a separate `GOPATH` for each app.
   * For Node, it installs whatever is in `package.json` into `node_modules`.
   * For Java, it builds your app depending on either `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
   * For Ruby, it does `bundle install` of your gems in an isolated folder.
* It then looks at a [`Procfile`](docs/DESIGN.md#procfile-format) which is [documented here](docs/DESIGN.md#procfile-format) and starts the relevant workers using [uWSGI][uwsgi] as a generic process manager.
* You can optionally also specify a `release` worker which is run once when the app is deployed.
* You can then remotely change application settings (`config:set`) or scale up/down worker processes (`ps:scale`).
* You can also bake application and `nginx` settings into an [`ENV`](./docs/ENV.md) file which is [documented here](./docs/ENV.md).

You can also deploy a `gh-pages` style static site using a `static` worker type, with the root path as the argument, and run a `release` task to do some processing on the server after `git push`.

### Virtual Hosts and SSL

`piku` has full virtual host support - i.e., you can host multiple apps on the same VPS and use DNS aliases to access them via different hostnames. 

`piku`  will also set up either a private certificate or obtain one via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to enable SSL.

If you are on a LAN and are accessing `piku` from macOS/iOS/Linux clients, you can try using [`piku/avahi-aliases`](https://github.com/piku/avahi-aliases) to announce different hosts for the same IP address via Avahi/mDNS/Bonjour.

### Caching and Static Paths

Besides static sites, `piku` also supports directly mapping specific URL prefixes to filesystem paths (to serve static assets) or caching back-end responses (to remove load from applications).

These features are configured by setting appropriate values in the [`ENV`](./docs/ENV.md) file.

### Supported Platforms

`piku` is intended to work in any POSIX-like environment where you have Python, `nginx`, [`uWSGI`][uwsgi] and SSH: it has been deployed on Linux, FreeBSD, [Cygwin][cygwin] and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux][wsl].

As a baseline, it began its development on an original 256MB Rasbperry Pi Model B, and still runs reliably on it.

But its main use is as a micro-PaaS to run applications on cloud servers with both Intel and ARM CPUs, with Debian and Ubuntu Linux as target platforms.

### Supported Runtimes

`piku` currently supports apps written in Python, Node, Clojure, Java and a few other languages (like Go) in the works.

But as a general rule, if it can be invoked from a shell, it can be run inside `piku`.

## Install

`piku` can manage multiple apps on a single machine, and all you need is a VPS, Raspberry Pi, or other server.

There are two main ways of deploying `piku` onto a new server:

* Use [`piku-bootstrap`](https://github.com/piku/piku-bootstrap) to reconfigure a new or existing Ubuntu virtual machine.
* Use `cloud-init` when creating a new virtual machine or barebones automated deployment (check [this repository](https://github.com/piku/cloud-init) for examples).

## Manage - via the `piku` helper

To make life easier you can also install the [piku](./piku) helper into your path (e.g. `~/bin`).

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piku/piku/master/piku > ~/bin/piku && chmod 755 ~/bin/piku
```

This shell script simplifies working with multiple `piku` remotes and applications:

* If you `cd` into a project folder that has a `git` remote called `piku` the helper will infer the remote server and app name and use them automatically:

```shell
$ piku logs
$ piku config:set MYVAR=12
$ piku stop
$ piku deploy
$ piku destroy
$ piku # <- show available remote and local commands
```

* If you are starting a new project, `piku init` will download example `Procfile` and `ENV` files into the current folder:

```shell
$ piku init
Wrote ./ENV file.
Wrote ./Procfile.
```

* The `piku` helper also lets you pass settings to the underlying SSH command: `-t` to run interactive commands remotely, and `-A` to proxy authentication credentials in order to do remote `git` pulls.

For instance, here's how to use the `-t` flag to obtain a `bash` shell in the app directory of one of your `piku` apps:

```shell
$ piku -t run bash
Piku remote operator.
Server: piku@cloud.mccormickit.com
App: dashboard

piku@piku:~/.piku/apps/dashboard$ ls
data  ENV  index.html  package.json  package-lock.json  Procfile  server.wisp
```
