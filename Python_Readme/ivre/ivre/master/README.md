# IVRE #

<img align="right" src="https://ivre.rocks/logo.png" alt="Logo"/> IVRE
(Instrument de veille sur les réseaux extérieurs) or DRUNK (Dynamic
Recon of UNKnown networks) is a network recon framework, including
tools for passive and active recon. IVRE can use data from:

- Passive tools:
  - [Zeek](https://zeek.org/)
  - [Argus](http://qosient.com/argus/)
  - [Nfdump](https://github.com/phaag/nfdump)
  - [p0f](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/)
  - [airodump-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/)
- Active tools:
  - [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
  - [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)
  - [ZGrab2](https://github.com/zmap/zgrab2)
  - [ZDNS](https://github.com/zmap/zdns)
  - [Nuclei](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/)
  - [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)
  - [dnsx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx)
  - [tlsx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/tlsx)
  - [Dismap](https://github.com/zhzyker/dismap/)

The advertising slogans are:

-   (in French): IVRE, il scanne Internet.
-   (in English): Know the networks, get DRUNK!
-   (in Latin): Nunc est bibendum.

The names IVRE and DRUNK have been chosen as a tribute to "Le
Taullier".

## Overview ##

You can have a look at the [project homepage](https://ivre.rocks/),
the
**[screenshot gallery](https://doc.ivre.rocks/en/latest/overview/screenshots.html)**,
and the
[quick video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBu5QMq6ewY)
for an overview of the Web interface.

We have a **demonstration instance**, just [contact us](#contact) to
get an access.

A few
**[blog posts](http://pierre.droids-corp.org/blog/html/tags/ivre.html)**
have been written to show some features of IVRE.

## Documentation ##

[IVRE's documentation](https://doc.ivre.rocks/) is hosted by Read The
Docs, based on files from the [doc/](doc/) directory of the
repository.

On an IVRE web server, the `doc/*` files are available, rendered,
under `/doc/`.

On a system with IVRE installed, you can use a `--help` option with
most IVRE CLI tools, and `help(ivre.module)` with most IVRE Python
sub-modules.

## Support ##

Try `--help` for the CLI tools, `help()` under Python and the "HELP"
button in the web interface.

Have a look at the
[FAQ](https://doc.ivre.rocks/en/latest/overview/faq.html)!

Feel free to contact the author and offer him a beer if you need help!

If you don't like beer, a good scotch or any other good alcoholic
beverage will do (it is the author's unalienable right to decide
whether a beverage is good or not).

## Contributing ##

Code contributions (pull-requests) are of course welcome!

The project needs scan results and capture files that can be provided
as examples. If you can contribute some samples, or if you want to
contribute some samples and would need some help to do so, or if you
can provide a server to run scans, please contact the author.

## Contact ##

For both support and contribution, the
[repository](https://github.com/ivre/ivre) on Github should be
used: feel free to create a new issue or a pull request!

You can also join the
[Gitter conversation](https://gitter.im/ivre/ivre) (that is the
preferred way to get in touch for questions), or use the e-mail `dev`
on the domain `ivre.rocks`.
