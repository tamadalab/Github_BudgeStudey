# Skater

Skater is a unified framework to enable Model Interpretation for all forms of model to help one build an Interpretable
machine learning system often needed for real world use-cases(** we are actively working towards to enabling faithful interpretability for all forms models). It is an open source python library designed to
demystify the learned structures of a black box model both globally(inference on the basis of a complete data set)
and locally(inference about an individual prediction).

The project was started as a research idea to find ways to enable better interpretability(preferably human interpretability) to predictive "black boxes" both for researchers and practioners. The project is still in beta phase.
