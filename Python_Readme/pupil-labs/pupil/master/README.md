**Open source eye tracking platform.**

Pupil is a project in active, community driven development. Pupil Core mobile eye tracking hardware is accessible, hackable, and affordable. The software is open source and written in `Python` and `C++` when speed is an issue.

Our vision is to create tools for a diverse group of people interested in learning about eye tracking and conducting their eye tracking projects.

You don't need to know how to write code to _use_ Pupil. [Download the latest apps](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/releases/latest#user-content-downloads "Download Pupil Capture, Pupil Player, and Pupil Service application bundles")!

Read the [Pupil Core user guide](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/ "Pupil Core user guide").

## Developers
There are a number of ways you can interact with Pupil Core software as a developer:

- [Use the API](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/network-api/): Use the network based real-time API to communicate with Pupil over the network and integrate with your application.
- [Develop a Plugin](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/plugin-api/): Plugins are loaded at runtime from the app bundle. Note: if your plugin requires Python libraries that are not included in the application bundle, then you will need to run from source.
- [Run from Source](#installing-dependencies): Can't do what you need to do with the network based api or plugin? Then get ready to dive into the inner workings of Pupil and run from source!

All setup and dependency installation instructions are contained in this repo. All other developer documentation is [here](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/overview/ "Pupil Core developer docs").

### Installing Dependencies and Code

To run the source code, you will need Python 3.7 or newer! We target Python 3.11 in our newer bundles and we recommend you to do the same.

Note: It is recommended to install the requirements into a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

Note: On arm64 macs (e.g. M1 MacBook Air), use the `python3.*-intel64` binary to create
the virtual environment. We do not yet provide arm64-native wheels for the Pupil Core
dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil.git
cd pupil
git checkout develop
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have trouble installing any of the dependencies, please see the corresponding
code repository for manual installation steps and troubleshooting.

#### Linux

##### USB Access

To grant Pupil Core applications access to the cameras, run

```sh
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb",  ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/10-libuvc.rules > /dev/null
sudo udevadm trigger
```

and ensure that your user is part of the `plugdev` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
```

##### Audio Playback

The [`sounddevice`](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.5/installation.html#installation) package depends on the `libportaudio2` library:

```sh
sudo apt install libportaudio2
```

### Run Pupil

```sh
cd pupil_src
python main.py capture # or player/service
```

#### Command Line Arguments
