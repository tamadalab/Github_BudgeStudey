# AutoEq
AutoEq is a tool for automatically equalizing headphones.

Go to **[autoeq.app](https://autoeq.app)** to get started.

This Github repository now mainly serves developers. The contributions of this project are:
* Web application for easily equalize and tweak headphone frequency responses without needing to install anything
* Library for working with (headphone) frequency responses and optimizing parametric equalizers
* [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/autoeq/) for installing the library on your projects
* Collection of headphone [measurements](./measurements) as numerical data from
[oratory1990](https://www.reddit.com/r/oratory1990/wiki/index/list_of_presets/),
[crinacle](https://crinacle.com),
[Innerfidelity](https://www.stereophile.com/content/innerfidelity-headphone-measurements),
[Rtings](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/1-5/graph) and legacy
headphone.com measurements (which are not the same as what the company produces today).
* Collection of different headphone frequency response [targets](./compensation) as numerical data
* Pre-computed equalizer settings in [results](./results), although these should not be used by normal users since
**[autoeq.app](https://autoeq.app)** exists

### Updates
**2022-05-14** Web application. Reorganized measurements and results.

**2022-10-30** Restructured the project and published in PyPi. Source code moved under [autoeq](./autoeq) directory and 
command line usage changed from `python autoeq.py` to `python -m autoeq` with underscores `_` replaced with hyphens `-`
in the parameter names. 

**2022-09-18** Parametric eq optimizer reworked. The new optimizer supports shelf filters, has a powerful configuration
system, run 10x faster, has limits for Fc, Q and gain value ranges and treats +10 kHz range as average value instead of
trying to fix it precisely.

## Usage
AutoEq produces settings for basically all types of equalizer apps but does not do the equalization itself. You'll need
a different app for that. Go to **[autoeq.app](https://autoeq.app)** and select your equalizer app of choice. Quick
instructions for importing the produced settings will be shown there.

## Command Line Use
In addition to the web application, AutoEq can be used from command line (terminal). This is advanced use mainly
intended for developers. The following instructions apply for command line and Python interface use.

### Installing
- Download and install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads. When installing Git on Windows, use Windows SSL verification
instead of Open SSL or you might run into problems when installing project dependencies.
- Download and install 64-bit **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/getit/)**. Make sure to check *Add Python 3.X to PATH*.
- You may need to install [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) if you're having problems with `soundfile`
when installing and/or running AutoEq.
- On Linux you may need to install Python dev packages
```shell
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
```
- On Linux you may need to install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- On Windows you may need to install
[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, and 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
- Open a terminal / command prompt. On Windows, search `cmd` in the start menu.
- Clone AutoEq
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq.git
```
- Go to AutoEq location
```shell
cd AutoEq
```
- Create a python virtual environment
```shell
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate virtualenv
```shell
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Linux and Mac
. venv/bin/activate
```
- Update pip
```shell
python -m pip install -U pip
```
- Install required packages
```shell
python -m pip install -U -e .
```
- Verify installation. If everything went well, you'll see the list of command line parameters AutoEq accepts.
```shell
python -m autoeq --help
```

When coming back at a later time you'll only need to activate virtual environment again
```shell
# On Windows
cd AutoEq
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Linux and Mac
cd AutoEq
. venv/bin/activate
```

To learn more about virtual environments, read [Python' venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/venv.html).

#### Updating
AutoEq is in active development and gets new measurements, results and features all the time. You can get the latest
version from git
```shell
git pull
```

Dependencies may change from time to time, you can update to the latest with
```shell
python -m pip install -U -e .
```

#### Checking Installation
This prints out CLI parameters if installation was successful.
```shell
python -m autoeq --help
```

### Example
Equalizing Sennheiser HD 650 and saving results to `my_results/`:
```shell
python -m autoeq --input-file="measurements/oratory1990/data/over-ear/Sennheiser HD 650.csv" --output-dir="my_results" --compensation="compensation/harman_over-ear_2018.csv" --convolution-eq --parametric-eq --ten-band-eq --fs=44100,48000
```

### Building
Build PyPi package on Windows
```shell
copy /y README.md README.md.bak && copy /y autoeq\README.md README.md && python -m build && copy /y README.md.bak README.md && del README.md.bak
```

Build PyPi package on Linux / MacOS
```shell
cp README.md README.md.bak && cp autoeq/README.md README.md && python -m build && cp README.md.bak README.md && rm README.md.bak
```

publish
```shell
python -m twine upload dist/autoeq-<VERSION>*
```

## Contact
[Issues](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/issues) are the way to go if you are experiencing problems or have
ideas or feature requests. Issues are not the correct channel for headphone requests because this project sources the
measurements from other databases and a headphone missing from AutoEq means it has not been measured by any of the
supported sources.
