Check out the `haxor-news` discussion in this [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11518596).

`haxor-news` brings Hacker News to the terminal, allowing you to **view**/**filter** the following without leaving your command line:

* Posts
* Post Comments
* Post Linked Web Content
* Monthly Hiring and Freelancers Posts
* User Info
* Onions

`haxor-news` helps you **filter the large number of comments that popular posts generate**.

* Want to expand only previously **unseen comments**?
    * `-cu/--comments_unseen`
* How about **recent comments** posted in the past 60 minutes?
    * `-cr/--comments_recent`
* Filter comments matching a **regex query**?
    * `-cq/--comments_query [query]`

## Syntax

Usage:

    $ hn <command> [params] [options]

## Auto-Completer and Interactive Help

Optionally, you can enable fish-style completions and an auto-completion menu with interactive help:

    $ haxor-news

If available, the auto-completer also automatically displays comments through a pager.

Within the auto-completer, the same syntax applies:

    haxor> hn <command> [params] [options]

```

For no color, set the value(s) to `None`.

## Commands

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oqvUbj8.png)

## View Posts

View the Top, Best, Show, Ask, Jobs, New, and Onion posts.

Usage:

    $ hn [command] [limit]  # post limit default: 10

Examples:

    $ hn top
    $ hn show 20

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/tjGPszv.png)

## View a Post's Linked Web Content

After viewing a list of posts, you can view a post's linked web content by referencing the post `#`.

The HTML contents of the post's link are **formatted for easy-viewing within your terminal**.  If available, the formatted output is sent to a pager.

See the [View in a Browser](#view-in-a-browser) section to view the contents in a browser instead.

Usage:

    $ hn view [#]

Example:

    $ hn view 1
    $ hn view 8

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/FoTCPAp.png)

## View and Filter a Post's Comments

### View All Comments

After viewing a list of posts, you can view a post's comments by referencing the post `#`.

Examples:

    $ hn view 8 -c
    $ hn view 8 --comments > comments.txt

#### Paged Comments

If running with the auto-completer, comments are automatically paginated.  To get the same pagination without the auto-completer, append `| less -r`:

    $ hn view 8 -c | less -r

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/t32ITvN.png)

### Filter on Unseen Comments

Filter comments to expand only those you have not yet seen.  Unseen comments are denoted with a `[!]` and are fully expanded.

Seen comments will be truncated with [...] and will be shown to help provide context to unseen comments.

Examples:

    $ hn view 8 -cu
    $ hn view 8 --comments_unseen | less -r

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/tCVpSIs.png)

### Filter on Recent Comments

Filter comments to expand only those **posted within the past 60 minutes**.

Older comments will be truncated with [...] and will be shown to help provide context to recent comments.

Examples:

    $ hn view 8 -cr | less -r
    $ hn view 8 --comments_recent

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/diOjxIr.png)

### Filter with Regex

Filter comments based on a given regular expression query.

Examples:

    $ hn view 2 -cq "(?i)programmer" | less -r
    $ hn view 2 --comments_regex_query "(?i)programmer" > programmer.txt

*Case insensitive regex: `(?i)`*

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/SlKtIpS.png)

### Hide Non-Matching Comments

When filtering comments for unseen, recent, or with regex, non-matching comments are collapsed to provide context.  To instead hide non-matching comments, pass the `-ch\--comments_hide` flag.  Hidden comments will be displayed as `.`.

Example:

    $ hn view 8 -cu -ch | less -r

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qPopK7X.png)

## Filter the Monthly Hiring Post

Hacker News hosts a monthly hiring post where employers post the latest job openings.

Usage:

    $ hn hiring [regex filter]

Examples:

    $ hn hiring ""
    $ hn hiring "(?i)JavaScript|Node"
    $ hn hiring "(?i)(Node|JavaScript).*(remote)" > remote_jobs.txt

*Case insensitive regex: `(?i)`*

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Lwz8iwG.png)

To search a different monthly hiring post other than the latest, use the hiring post id.

Usage:

    $ hn hiring [regex filter] [post id]

## Filter the Freelancers Post

Hacker News hosts a monthly freelancers post where employers and freelancers post availabilities.

Usage:

    $ hn freelance [regex filter]

Examples:

    $ hn freelance ""
    $ hn freelance "(?i)JavaScript|Node"
    $ hn freelance "(?i)(Node|JavaScript).*(remote)" > remote_jobs.txt

*Case insensitive regex: `(?i)`*

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/TnBDFGk.png)

To search a different monthly hiring post other than the latest, use the hiring post id.

Usage:

    $ hn freelance [regex filter] [post id]

## Combine With Pipes and Redirects

Output to pagers, write to files, automate with cron, etc.

Examples:

    $ hn view 1 -c | less
    $ hn freelance "(?i)(Node|JavaScript).*(remote)" > remote_jobs.txt

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/x2aj7SM.png)

## View User Info

Usage:

    $ hn user [user id]

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oTALQQI.png)

## View Onions

Usage:

    $ hn onion [limit]  # post limit default: all

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/MubWRNG.png)

## View in a Browser

View the linked web content or comments in your default browser instead of your terminal.

Usage:

    $ hn <command> [params] [options] -b
    $ hn <command> [params] [options] --browser

## Windows Support

`haxor-news` has been tested on Windows 10.

### Pager Support

Pager support on Windows is more limited as discussed in the following [ticket](https://github.com/donnemartin/haxor-news/issues/16).  Users can direct output to a pager with the `| more` command:

    $ hn view 1 -c | more

### Config File

On Windows, the `.haxornewsconfig` file can be found in `%userprofile%`.  For example:

    C:\Users\dmartin\.haxornewsconfig

### `cmder` and `conemu`

Although you can use the standard Windows command prompt, you'll probably have a better experience with either [cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) or [conemu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu).

## Installation

### Pip Installation

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/haxor-news.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/py/haxor-news) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/haxor-news.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/haxor-news/)
