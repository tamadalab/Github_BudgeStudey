## Big Sur

Significant changes have been made to Spotlight in Big Sur add that on top of the fact Flashlight was already partly broken in recent releases, around 10.15.5 and beyond, I've decided to discontinue my efforts in this project. There are also not many users 387 on v1.2 according to analytics.

## Writing Plugins

**Start with the [tutorial on writing plugins](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/wiki/Creating-a-Plugin).**

Once you're finished with a plugin, clone our repo, place your bundle in `PluginDirectories/1`, and we'll upload it to the online directory.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to the Flashlight core and plugins. See [the wiki](https://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight/wiki/Contributing-to-Flashlight-and-Plugins) for more info.
