# Home Assistant Configuration

Here's my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I have installed HA on an [Intel NUC SkullCanyon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DJ9XS52/) with [32GB RAM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015YPB8ME/) and [500GB NVMe SSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYFKJR7/). I am currently running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on the NUC and used the [virtual environment](https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/virtualenv/) approach to install HA.

I regularly update my configuration files. You can check my current HA version [here](.HA_VERSION). If you like anything here, Be sure to :star2: my repo!

## Other things that I run on my NUC

* [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)

* [Machinebox](https://machinebox.io/) image tagging service in a Docker container using the following command. First obtain your [API key](https://machinebox.io/login) and assign it to `MB_KEY` and then run the container using (you can access the Tagbox interface at http://ip.ad.dr.es:8081):
 ```
 $ sudo docker run --name=machinebox -p 8081:8080 -e "MB_KEY=$MB_KEY" -d machinebox/tagbox
 ```
