# Ansible Container

Ansible Container is a tool for building Docker images and orchestrating containers using Ansible playbooks.

## How it works

Use Ansible Container to manage the container lifecycle from development, through testing, to production:

* `ansible-container init`

  Creates a directory *ansible* with files to get you started. Read the comments, and edit to suit your needs.

* `ansible-container install`

  Downloads Ansible-Container-ready roles from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com), and installs them in your project.

* `ansible-container build`

  Creates images from your Ansible playbooks.

* `ansible-container run`

  Launches the containers specified in the orchestration document, *container.yml*, for testing the built images. The 
  format of *container.yml* is nearly identical to Docker Compose.

* `ansible-container deploy`

  Pushes the project's container images to a registry of your choice, and generates a playbook capable of deploying the project on a supported cloud provider.

## Installing

Install using *pip*, the Python package manager:

    $ sudo pip install ansible-container[docker,openshift]
    
Or, to install without root privileges, use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to first create a 
Python sandbox:
    
    $ virtualenv ansible-container
    $ source ansible-container/bin/activate
    $ pip install ansible-container[docker,openshift]

For more details, prerequisite, and instructions on installing the latest development release, please view our 
[Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container/installation.html).
