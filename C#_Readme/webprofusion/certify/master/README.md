## Build

Create a directory for the various repos to clone to, e.g. `C:\git\certify_dev` and clone the following repos into this location:
- https://github.com/webprofusion/certify.git
- https://github.com/webprofusion/certify-plugins.git

In addition, create a \libs subdirectory and clone:
- anvil:  https://github.com/webprofusion/anvil.git
- bc-sharp: git clone --branch 2.2-trimmed https://github.com/webprofusion/bc-csharp

Run `dotnet build Certify.Core.Service.sln` and `dotnet build Certify.UI.sln` or open using Visual Studio. The UI needs the service running to connect to for normal operation.

When developing plugins, the plugin and dependencies of the plugin need to be copied to the debug \plugins\ location for the service to load them.
