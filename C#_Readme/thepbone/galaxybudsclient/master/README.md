## Key Features

Configure and control any Samsung Galaxy Buds device and integrate them into your desktop.

Aside from standard features known from the official Android app, this project helps you to release the full potential of your earbuds and implements new functionality such as:

* Detailed battery statistics
* Diagnostics and factory self-tests
* Loads of hidden debugging information
* Customizable long-press touch actions
* Firmware flashing, downgrading (Buds+, Buds Pro)
* and much more...

## Download

There are several Linux packages available:
* [Flatpak (All Linux distros)](#flatpak)
* [AUR package (Arch Linux)](#aur-package)

Get binaries for Windows in the [release](https://github.com/ThePBone/GalaxyBudsClient/releases) section. Please read the release notes before installation:
<p align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/ThePBone/GalaxyBudsClient/releases"><img alt="Download" src="https://github.com/ThePBone/GalaxyBudsClient/blob/master/screenshots/download.png"></a>
</p>

### Flatpak

Universal binary packages for all Linux distributions. This is the recommended way of installing GalaxyBudsClient on Linux.

Available for download on FlatHub: https://flathub.org/apps/me.timschneeberger.GalaxyBudsClient
```
flatpak install me.timschneeberger.GalaxyBudsClient
```

> **Note**: Flatpaks are sandboxed. This application can only access `~/.var/app/me.timschneeberger.GalaxyBudsClient/` by default.

### AUR package 

An [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/galaxybudsclient-bin/) for Arch Linux maintained by @joscdk is also available:
```
yay -S galaxybudsclient-bin
```

### winget

The Windows package is also available to install with Windows Package Manager (winget)

```
winget install ThePBone.GalaxyBudsClient
```

## How it works

In order to use Bluetooth wireless technology, a device must be able to interpret specific Bluetooth profiles that enable Bluetooth devices to communicate efficiently with each other.

The Galaxy Buds define two Bluetooth profiles: A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) for audio streaming/controlling and SPP (Serial Port Profile) for transmitting binary streams. Manufacturers often use this profile (which relies on the RFCOMM protocol) to exchange configuration data, perform firmware updates, or send other commands to the Bluetooth device.

Even though the A2DP profile is standardized and documented, the format of the binary data exchanged by this RFCOMM protocol is usually proprietary.

To reverse-engineer this data format, I started by analyzing the structure of the binary stream sent by the earbuds. Later on, I also disassembled the official Galaxy Buds apps for Android to gain more insight into these devices' inner workings. You can find some (incomplete) notes I took down below. Check the source code to get more detailed information on the structure of the protocol.

</p>

While taking a closer look at the Galaxy Buds Plus, I also noticed some unusual features, such as a firmware debug mode, an unused pairing mode, and a Bluetooth key dumper. I documented these findings here:

  <a href="https://github.com/ThePBone/GalaxyBudsClient/blob/master/GalaxyBudsPlus_HiddenDebugFeatures.md">Galaxy Buds Plus: Unusual features</a>
</p>

Currently, I'm looking into modifying and reverse-engineering the firmware for the Buds+. At time of writing I have created two tools to fetch and analyze official firmware binaries. Check them out here:

Stream head-tracking data in realtime from your Buds Pro using this script: [ThePBone/BudsPro-Headtracking](https://github.com/ThePBone/BudsPro-Headtracking)
