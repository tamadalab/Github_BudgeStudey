FluentFTP is a fully managed FTP and FTPS client library for .NET & .NET Standard, optimized for speed. It provides extensive FTP commands, File uploads/downloads, SSL/TLS connections, Automatic directory listing parsing, File hashing/checksums, File permissions/CHMOD, FTP proxies, FXP transfers, UTF-8 support, Async/await support, Powershell support and more.

It is written entirely in C#, with no external dependency. It has an extensive automated test suite which tests all its functionality against local FTP server docker containers.

FluentFTP is released under the permissive MIT License, so it can be used in both proprietary and free/open source applications.

## Example Usage

To get started, check out the [Quick start example in C#](https://github.com/robinrodricks/FluentFTP/wiki/Quick-Start-Example).

We also have extensive examples for all methods in [C#](https://github.com/robinrodricks/FluentFTP/tree/master/FluentFTP.CSharpExamples) and [VB.NET](https://github.com/robinrodricks/FluentFTP/tree/master/FluentFTP.VBExamples).

## Documentation and FAQs

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/robinrodricks/FluentFTP/wiki).

## Tests

We have an extensive [automated test suite](https://github.com/robinrodricks/FluentFTP/wiki/Automated-Testing) that tests FluentFTP against many servers. We use docker to orchestrate containerized FTP servers that are used for testing.


## Sponsorship

If FluentFTP helped you or your organization, consider [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/robinrodricks) by donating a small amount per month. Even $20 goes a long way! Everything I receive goes into household expenses and paying the bills. 

I have been a freelancer for more than a decade, and your contributions go towards supporting my work and my family. I only recently started asking for donations to fund the time I spend on these open source projects.
