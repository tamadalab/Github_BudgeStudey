# Patterns and Practices #

You should be using [SharePoint Framework](https://aka.ms/spfx) for UX layer extensibility for SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. You can find [SPFx web part](https://aka.ms/spfx-webparts) and [SPFx extension](https://aka.ms/spfx-webparts) samples from different repository. You can use Azure AD and Microsoft Teams Solution model as replacement for the provider hosted add-in model. Please see https://aka.ms/m365pnp for the up to date guidance and samples.
