[Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) is the friendly tool for writing dialogue in games. It's easy for writers to use, and has powerful features for programmers.

Yarn Spinner is a dialogue system that lets you write interactive conversations in a simple, screenplay-like format, which can be loaded into your game and run. 

When a conversation is running, Yarn Spinner sends your game **lines** of dialogue to show, **options** to let the player choose from, and **commands** to make things happen in your scene.

Yarn Spinner has been used in a number of critically acclaimed games, including [Night in the Woods](http://nightinthewoods.com), [A Short Hike](https://ashorthike.com), [Lost in Random](https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/lost-in-random), and many more.

It's free to download and use for free and commercial games, and is open source under the terms of the MIT License.
