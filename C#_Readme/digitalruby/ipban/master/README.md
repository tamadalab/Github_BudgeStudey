**Requirements**
- IPBan free version requires .NET 6 SDK to build and debug code. For an IDE, I suggest Visual Studio Community for Windows, or VS code for Linux. All are free. You can build a self contained executable to eliminate the need for dotnet core on the server machine, or just download the precompiled binaries in releases.
- Running and/or debugging code requires that you run your IDE or terminal as administrator or root.
- Officially supported platforms: Windows 8.1 or newer (x86, x64), Windows Server 2012 or newer (x86, x64), Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RedHat x64). Windows Server 2008 will work with some tweaks, but it is basically at end of life, so no longer officially supported. Please note that for CentOS and RedHat Linux, you will need to manually install iptables and ipset using yum package manager.
- Mac OS X not supported at this time.

**Features**
- Auto ban ip addresses on Windows and Linux by detecting failed logins from event viewer and/or log files. On Linux, SSH is watched by default. On Windows, RDP, OpenSSH, VNC, MySQL, SQL Server and Exchange are watched. More applications can easily be added via config file.
- Highly configurable, many options to determine failed login count threshold, time to ban, etc.
- Make sure to check out the ipban.config file (formerly named DigitalRuby.IPBan.dll.config, see IPBanCore project) for configuration options, each option is documented with comments.
- Banning happens basically instantly for event viewer. For log files, you can set how often it polls for changes.
- Very fast - I've optimized and tuned this code since 2012. The bottleneck is pretty much always the firewall implementation, not this code.
- Unban ip addresses easily by placing an unban.txt file into the service folder with each ip address on a line to unban.
- Works with ipv4 and ipv6 on all platforms.
- Please visit the wiki at https://github.com/DigitalRuby/IPBan/wiki for lots more documentation.

Install
------

Please note that for IPBan Pro, you can find install instructions at https://ipban.com/Docs/Install. These install instructions here on github are for the free IPBan version.

**Windows**
- IPBan is supported on Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, or newer.
- Easy one click install, open admin powershell and run:
```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalRuby/IPBan/master/IPBanCore/Windows/Scripts/install_latest.ps1'))
```
Note: Powershell 5.1 or greater is required.

***Additional Windows Notes***
- Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 are nearing end of life. Upgrading to a newer Windows version is highly recommended. Support will drop for these Windows versions on January 1, 2024.
- For Windows Server 2012 only: Disable NLA and enable NTLM. Otherwise ip addresses of remote connections do not show up in the event viewer. There is no known workaround that I know of to fix this, other than turning off NLA and enabling NTLM. Newer Windows (Server 2016+, Windows 10+) are not impacted by this problem.
- Please ensure your server and clients are patched before making the above change: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4093492/credssp-updates-for-cve-2018-0886-march-13-2018. You need to manually edit group policy as specified in the link.

- On Windows Server running Exchange, it is impossible to disable NTLM (deny all clients in Security restrict ntlm incoming ntlm traffic) as then Outlook on client computers permanently asks users for entering username and password. To workaround this, set LAN Manager authenticating level in Security Options of Local Policies to "Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM". There is one small issue â€“ when somebody tries to login with an undefined username, the log does not contain an IP address. Not sure why Microsoft can't log an ip address properly.
- If using Exchange, disabling app pool 'MSExchangeServicesAppPool' can eliminate quite a lot of problems in the event viewer with ip addresses not being logged.

**Linux**

- IPBan is supported on most Linux operating systems.
- Easy one click install:
```
sudo -i; bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalRuby/IPBan/master/IPBanCore/Linux/Scripts/Install.sh)
```
