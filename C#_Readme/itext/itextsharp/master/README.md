### **PLEASE NOTE: iTextSharp is EOL, and has been replaced by [iText 7][itext7]. Only security fixes will be added**

- HTML to PDF (PDF/UA) conversion
- PDF Redaction
- SVG support
- Better language support: Indic, Thai, Khmer, Arabic, Hebrew. (Close-source addon)
- PDF Debugging for your IDE
- Data Extraction
- Better continued support and bugfixes
- More modular, extensible handling of your document workflow
- Extra practical add-ons
- Encryption, hashing & digital signatures
