[简体中文 | Simplified Chinese](README_CN.md)

GitHub is a global platform, and theoretically, everyone should use English. But since this project is mostly meant for Chinese user and rely on a Chinese website [BiliBili](https://live.bilibili.com) ([_wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili)), all code comments are in Chinese. This README file will always use English so people like _you_ can understand what is this, and perhaps make some use out of it.
