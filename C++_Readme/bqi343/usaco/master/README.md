# README

Some material has been moved to the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/).

## Notes

I am not planning to update:

- READMEs for most implementations
- USACO problem tables and solutions
  - Tables for recent USACO problems can be found [here](https://usaco.guide/general/usaco-monthlies).

Since I frequently move stuff around, some READMEs may refer to files which no longer exist. If you would like to contribute, provide feedback, or encourage me to update something, please email me at *bqi343@gmail.com* or submit a pull request. If you have a question, please read the entirety of "Resources" -> "Questions.md" first.
