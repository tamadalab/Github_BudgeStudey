- A work-in-progress baremetal MIDI synthesizer for the Raspberry Pi 3 or above, based on [Munt], [FluidSynth] and [Circle].
- Turn your Raspberry Pi into a dedicated emulation of the [famous multi-timbre sound module][Roland MT-32] used by countless classic MS-DOS, PC-98 and Sharp X68000 games!
- Add your favorite [SoundFonts][SoundFont] to expand your synthesizer with [General MIDI], [Roland GS], or even [Yamaha XG] support for endless MIDI possibilities.
- Includes General MIDI and Roland GS support out of the box thanks to [GeneralUser GS] by S. Christian Collins.
- No operating system, no complex Linux audio configuration; just super-low latency audio.
- Easy to configure and ready to play from cold-boot in a matter of seconds.
- The perfect companion for your vintage PC or [MiSTer FPGA] setup.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Project status

<img title="mt32-pi running on the Raspberry Pi 3 A+ with the Arananet PI-MIDI HAT." width="280rem" align="right" src="images/mt32pi_pimidi.png">

- Supports Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+, B, and B+, Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and CM4 series.
  * Pi 2 works, but only with concessions on playback quality.
  * Pi Zero (original) and Pi 1 are unfortunately too slow (even with an overclock) and unsupported.
- PWM headphone jack audio.
  * Quality is known to be poor (aliasing/distortion on quieter sounds).
  * It is not currently known whether this can be improved or not.
- [I¬≤S Hi-Fi DAC support][I¬≤S Hi-Fi DACs].
  * This is the recommended audio output method for the best quality audio.
- MIDI input via [USB][USB MIDI interfaces], [GPIO][GPIO MIDI interface] MIDI interfaces, or the [serial port].
- [Configuration file] for selecting hardware options and fine tuning.
- [LCD status screen support][LCD and OLED displays] (for MT-32 SysEx messages and status information).
- Simple [physical control surface][control surface] using buttons and rotary encoder.
- [MiSTer FPGA integration via user port][MiSTer FPGA].
- Network MIDI support via [RTP-MIDI] and [raw UDP socket].
- [Embedded FTP server][FTP server] for remote access to files.
- A user interface with menu system is _planned_.
- More advanced MIDI routing is _planned_.

## ‚ú® Quick-start guide

üÜï If you have a Linux computer or MiSTer FPGA device, you may wish to try the new interactive [mt32-pi installer script](scripts).

Otherwise, for a manual installation:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases] section.
    * If you are **updating an old version**, read the [Updating mt32-pi] wiki page for the correct procedure.
2. Extract contents to a blank [FAT32-formatted SD card][SD card preparation].
    * Read the [SD card preparation] wiki page for hints on formatting an SD card correctly (especially under Windows).
3. For MT-32 support, add your MT-32 or CM-32L ROM images to the `roms` directory - you have to provide these for copyright reasons.
    * You will need at least one control ROM and one PCM ROM.
    * For information on using multiple ROM sets and switching between them, see the [MT-32 synthesis] wiki page.
    * The file names or extensions don't matter; mt32-pi will scan and detect their types automatically.
4. Optionally add your favorite SoundFonts to the `soundfonts` directory.
    * For information on using multiple SoundFonts and switching between them, see the [SoundFont synthesis] wiki page.
    * Again, file names/extensions don't matter.
5. Edit the `mt32-pi.cfg` file to enable any optional hardware (Hi-Fi DAC, displays, buttons). Refer to [the wiki][mt32-pi wiki] to find supported hardware.
    * **MiSTer users**: Read the [MiSTer setup] section of the wiki for the recommended configuration, and ignore the following two steps.
6. Connect a [USB MIDI interface][USB MIDI interfaces] or [GPIO MIDI circuit][GPIO MIDI interface] to the Pi, and connect some speakers to the headphone jack.
7. Connect your vintage PC's MIDI OUT to the Pi's MIDI IN and (optionally) vice versa.

## üìö Documentation

More detailed documentation for mt32-pi can now be found over at the [mt32-pi wiki]. Please read the wiki pages to learn about all of mt32-pi's features and supported hardware, and consider helping us improve it!

## ‚ùì Help

Take a look at our [FAQ] page for answers to the most common questions about mt32-pi.

If you need some help with mt32-pi and the wiki doesn't answer your questions, head over to the [discussions] area and feel free to start a topic.

> ‚ö† **Note**: Please don't use the Issues area to ask for help - Issues are intended for reproducible bug reports and feature requests. Thank you!

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing

This project is generally quite stable and very usable, but still considered by its author to be in early stages of development.

Hence, please **DO NOT** work on large features and open pull requests without prior discussion. There is a strong possibility that work-in-progress code for proposed features already exists, but may not yet be public, and your work will have to be rejected.

Trivial changes to the code that fix issues are always welcome, as are improvements to documentation, and hardware/software compatibility reports.
