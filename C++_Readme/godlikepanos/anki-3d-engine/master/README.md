2 Building AnKi
===============

![Build Status Linux](https://github.com/godlikepanos/anki-3d-engine/actions/workflows/Linux.yml/badge.svg)
![Build Status Windows](https://github.com/godlikepanos/anki-3d-engine/actions/workflows/Windows.yml/badge.svg)
![Build Status Android](https://github.com/godlikepanos/anki-3d-engine/actions/workflows/Android.yml/badge.svg)

To checkout the source type:

	git clone https://github.com/godlikepanos/anki-3d-engine.git anki

AnKi's build system is using `CMake`. A great effort was made to ease the building process that's why the number of
external dependencies are almost none.

2.1 On Linux
------------

Prerequisites:

- Cmake 3.10 and up
- GCC 5.0 and up or Clang 6.0 and up
- libx11-dev installed
- libxrandr-dev installed
- libx11-xcb-dev installed
- [Optional] libxinerama-dev if you want proper multi-monitor support

To build the release version:

	$cd path/to/anki
	$mkdir build
	$cd ./build
	$cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	$make

To view and configure the build options you can use `ccmake` tool or other similar tool:

	$cd path/to/anki/build
	$ccmake .

This will open an interface with all the available options.

2.2 On Windows
--------------

Prerequisites:

- Cmake 3.10 and up
- Python 3.0 and up
	- Make sure that the python executable's location is in `PATH` environment variable
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and up
	- Make sure that `Windows 10 SDK (xxx) for Desktop C++ [x86 and x64]` component is installed

To build the release version open `PowerShell` and type:

	$cd path/to/anki
	$mkdir build
	$cd build
	$cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	$cmake --build . --config Release

Alternatively, recent Visual Studio versions support building CMake projects from inside the IDE:

- Open Visual Studio
- Choose the "open a local folder" option and open AnKi's root directory (where this README.md is located)
- Visual Studio will automatically understand that AnKi is a CMake project and it will populate the CMake cache
- Press "build all"

2.3 For Android
---------------

Prerequisites:

- Android Studio
- From Android Studio's package manager you need to install `NDK` and `CMake`
- Having built AnKi for your host operating system (Linux or Windows)

Android builds work a bit differently from Linux and Windows. First you need to have built AnKi for your host operating
system. That's because Android builds requires the `ShaderCompiler/ShaderCompiler.exe` to compile the shaders for
Android. Then you have to generate a gradle project per build target.

For example, if you want to generate a project for the `Sponza` sample just type from a Linux terminal:

	$cd path/to/anki
	$./Samples/Sponza/GenerateAndroidProject.sh path/to/Binaries/ShaderCompiler

or from a PowerShell terminal on Windows:

	$cd path/to/anki
	$./Samples/Sponza/GenerateAndroidProject.bat path/to/Binaries/ShaderCompiler.exe

The `GenerateAndroidProject` scripts will generate a project in the root directory of AnKi. So for the `Sponza` sample
the script will create a directory named `AndroidProject_Sponza`.

Then you can open the `AndroidProject_Sponza` project from `Android Studio` and build it, debug it, run it etc.

3 Next steps
============

This code repository contains **4 sample projects** that are built by default (`ANKI_BUILD_SAMPLES` CMake option):

- `Sponza`: The Crytek's Sponza scene
- `SimpleScene`: A simple scene (Cornell box)
- `PhysicsPlayground`: A scene with programmer's art and some physics interactions
- `SkeletalAnimation`: A simple scene with an animated skin

You can try running them and interacting with them. To run sponza, for example, execute the binary from any working
directory.

On Linux:

	$./path/to/build/Binaries/Sponza

On Windows just find the `Sponza.exe` and execute it. It's preferable to run the samples from a terminal because that
prints some information, including possible errors.
