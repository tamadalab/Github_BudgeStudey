##Building

Open `./Application/` in Android Studio and build.  You'll need the NDK installed if you don't already have it, instructions below.

##Building release build

Copy `build-release.sh.template` to `build-release.sh`.

Modify each of these exported environment variables: `LINK_BUBBLE_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`, `LINK_BUBBLE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, and `LINK_BUBBLE_KEY_PASSWORD`.

If you get an error about similar to:

> Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES]

Try uninstalling the application which already exists on your plugged in device.

##Installing the NDK

Android Studio has an easy way to download and link to the NDK.

In the menu navigate to File, Project Structure. Click the 'Download Android NDK' link. This should download and unzip the NDK, as well as link it inside of local.properties.

If you are not using Android Studio, reference this commit: https://github.com/brave/browser-android/commit/0fa9f58286e0679ec5772e19b995d6a508907691

##Telling getlocalization.com about new strings

1. Periodically upload the file `./Application/LinkBubble/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` to [getlocalization.com](https://www.getlocalization.com/LinkBubble/files/).  getlocalization.com will determine which strings are new
2. When prompted on getlocalization.com, press the mark for retranslation (or keep existing) for changed strings.

##Getting new translated strings from getlocalization.com

1. Install npm dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run translate <username> <password>` to pull down the translated xml files.
3. Commit and push your change.

Remember to uncomment `checkStrings` from `MainApplication` and call it in `onCreate` to make sure the pulled files don't cause crashes with format specifiers.

##ADB

If you don't have `adb` in your path add it to your `~/.bash_profile` or similar file:

`export PATH=/Users/<your-username>/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH`

- **Installing an apk onto your device:**  
  `adb install -r ./LinkBubble/build/outputs/apk/LinkBubble-playstore-release.apk`
- **Getting a list of devices:**
  `adb devices`
