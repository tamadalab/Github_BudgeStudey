If you want to start using RoboSpice right now, jump to the [Wiki](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice/wiki) or the [samples](https://github.com/octo-online/RoboSpice-samples).

The [Wiki](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice/wiki) has a fully detailed section to quickly setup you up whether you use Gradle, Maven or ant/eclipse.


Main features of RoboSpice
--------------------------
* supports Android starting *_from_ SDK version 8 (Froyo / 2.2.x)* 
* executes network requests **asynchronously** (in a background AndroidService)
* supports **REST** out of the box (using [Spring Android](http://www.springsource.org/spring-android) or [Google Http Client](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client) or [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)).
* is strongly typed ! You query webservices using **POJOs** as parameters and you get **POJOs** as request results.
* enforces no constraints neither on POJOs used for requests nor on Activity classes you use in your projects
* **caches results** in Json with both [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) or [Jackson2](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20) or [Gson](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/),
or [Xml](http://simple.sourceforge.net/), or flat text files, or binary files, even using [ORM Lite](http://ormlite.com/sqlite_java_android_orm.shtml) (still in beta)
* notifies your activities (or any other context) of the result of the network request **with respect to their lifecycles**.
* notifies your activities (or any other context) on the **UI Thread**
* **no memory leaks** at all, like Android Loaders, unlike Android AsyncTasks
* uses a simple but **robust** exception handling model
* supports **multi-threading** of request executions
* is **stable**, **efficient** and designed to respect Android philosophy
* supports request **cancelling**, request **priorization** and requests  **aggregation**
* supports aggregation of different web services
* is a full featured replacement for long running AsyncTasks even if they are not related to networking.
* is **open source** ;) 
* and **tested** (more than 200 tests)

RoboSpice is [under Quality control on Sonar's Nemo instance](http://nemo.sonarsource.org/dashboard/index/504442). Thanks to Sonar Source.
