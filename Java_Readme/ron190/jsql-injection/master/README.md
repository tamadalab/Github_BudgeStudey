## Description
**jSQL Injection** is a lightweight application used to find database information from a server.

It's **free**, **open source** and **cross-platform** for Windows, Linux and Mac and it works with Java from version 11 to 17.

![Kali Linux logo](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/raw/master/web/images/kali_favicon.png "Kali Linux logo") jSQL Injection is also part of the official penetration testing distribution [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org/) and is included in various other distributions like [Pentest Box](https://pentestbox.com/), [Parrot Security OS](https://www.parrotsec.org), [ArchStrike](https://archstrike.org/) and [BlackArch Linux](http://www.blackarch.org/).

- Various injection processes: Default, Zip, Dios
- Database fingerprint: Basic error, Order By error, Boolean single query
- Script sandboxes for SQL and tampering
- List to inject multiple targets
- Read and write files using injection
- Create and display Web shell and SQL shell
- Bruteforce password hash
- Search for admin pages
- Hash, encode and decode text
- Authenticate using Basic, Digest, NTLM and Kerberos  
- Proxy connection on HTTP, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5

## Installation [[jsql-injection-v0.85.jar](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/releases/download/v0.85/jsql-injection-v0.85.jar)]
Install [Java](http://java.com) 11 or up to 17, then download the latest [release](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/releases/) and double-click on the file `jsql-injection-v0.85.jar` to launch the software.<br>
You can also type `java -jar jsql-injection-v0.85.jar` in your terminal to start the program.<br>
If you are using Kali Linux then get the latest release using command `sudo apt-get -f install jsql`, or make a system full upgrade with `apt update` then `apt full-upgrade`.<br>
To run older version on Java 16+ use `java --illegal-access=warn --add-exports java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.http=ALL-UNNAMED -jar jsql-injection-v0.84.jar`.

## Continuous integration
This software is developed using open source libraries like [Spring](https://spring.io), [Spock](http://spockframework.org) and [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org) and is tested using continuous integration platform Github Actions.<br> 
Non regression tests are run against dockerized and in memory databases and GUI is tested on VNC screen on the CI platforms, then quality checks are stored on code quality platforms.

## [[Test-bed scripts for Spring](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/tree/master/model/src/test/java/spring/rest)]
See test scripts used for CI integration.

## [[Test-bed scripts for PHP](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/tree/master/web/test-bed)]
Use the sample PHP scripts to test injection on your local environment. First install a development environment like [EasyPHP](http://www.easyphp.org), then download the [test-bed PHP scripts](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/tree/master/web/test-bed) and move them into `www/`.
```php
<?php
# http://127.0.0.1/mysql/strategy/get-normal.php?id=0

$link = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', '', 'my_database');

$result = $link->query("SELECT col1, col2 FROM my_table where id=$_GET[id]");

while ($row = $result->fetch_array($result, MYSQLI_NUM))
    echo join(',', $row);
```
