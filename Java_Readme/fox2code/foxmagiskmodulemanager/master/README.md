# Androidacy Module Manager

### Developed by Androidacy. Find us on the web [here](https://www.androidacy.com/?utm_source=fox-readme&utm_medium=web&utm_campagin=github).

_If you're seeing this at the Fox2Code repo, the new repo is at [Androidacy/AndroidacyModuleManager](https://github.com/Androidacy/AndroidacyModuleManager)! The old repo may not receive consistent updates anymore!_

## About

The official Magisk Manager app has dropped it's support for downloading online modules, leaving users without a way to easily search for and download them. This app was created to help users download and install modules, and manage their own modules.

**This app is not officially supported by Magisk or its developers**

**The modules shown in this app are not affiliated with this app or Magisk**.

## Features
- Download and install modules
- Manage your own modules
- Search for and download modules
- Supports custom repos
- Separate lists of local and remote modules
- Check for module updates automatically
- Monet theming
- Fully MD3 themed 
- (Coming soon) Repo creation wizard
- (Coming soon) Module creator

### We'd like to thank Fox2Code for his initial work on the app.

This app was previously known as Fox's Magisk Module Manager (FoxMMM) and may still be referred to as that. Androidacy thanks Fox2Code for their initial work on this app, and wishes him the best in his future endeavours.

**Please do not use GitHub issues for help or questions. GitHub issues are specifically for bug
reporting and general app feedback.**

If a module is in multiple repos, the manager will just pick the most up to date version of the
module, if a module is in multiple repos it will just use first registered repo.

## For developers

The manager can read a few new meta keys to allow modules to customize their own entry

It also use `minApi`, `maxApi` and `minMagisk` in the `module.prop` to detect compatibility  
And support the `support` and `donate` properties to allow them to add their own support links  
And if you want to be event fancier you can setup `config` to your own config app.  
(Note: the manager use fallback values for some modules, see developer documentation for more info)

It also add new ways to control the installer ui via a new `#!` command system  
It allows module developers to craft a more customizable install experience.

If you created and uploaded a module and it doesn't appear in your module list you can disable
the low quality filter in the app settings after enabling developer mode. **Ideally, we recommend you to fix your module metadata rather than disabling that filter.**

For more information please check the [developer documentation](docs/DEVELOPERS.md)
