# Cucumber Common Components

Cucumber is made up of several libraries, many of which are kept in _polyglot_ repositories, meaning we keep multiple language implementations of the same library together in the same repo.

| Library                | Description                        | Latest release |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [cucumber-expressions] | Pattern-matching for Gherkin steps | ![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cucumber/cucumber-expressions?sort=semver) |
| [tag-expressions] | For parsing tag selection queries | ![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cucumber/tag-expressions?sort=semver) |
