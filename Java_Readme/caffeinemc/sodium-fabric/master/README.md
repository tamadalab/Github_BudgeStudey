Sodium is a free and open-source optimization mod which attempts to improve frame rates,
reduce micro-stutter, and fix graphical issues in Minecraft.

:warning: This mod is currently in a very early stage of development. There are numerous
serious, game-breaking issues. The codebase is also not in the best state currently. You
should not use this in your game unless you are absolutely willing to deal with serious
issues.

### Compiling the mod

You will need the latest version of Gradle 5.5 present on your system along with the Java 11 JDK. For Windows users, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) or [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/)
to manage these installations. These should be standard packages on most other operating systems. Alternatively, you can use the included Gradle wrapper with `gradlew`.

Once the prerequisites have been met, start a build with:

```
gradle build
```

The resulting build artifacts will be present in `build/libs`.
