`master` contains the current release version of Transdroid while `dev` contains the active development version.
However, larger and new features will be developed in their own branch.

Code structure
==============

Starting with version 2.3.0, Transdroid is developed in Android Studio, fully integrating with the Gradle build system.
It is (since version 2.5.21) compiled against Android 12 (API level 31) and (since version 2.2.0) supporting Android ICS (API level 15) and up only.
To support lite (Transdrone, specially for the Play Store) and full (Transdroid) versions of the app, build flavours are defined in gradle, which contain version-specific resources.
Dependencies are managed via JCentral et al. in the app's build.gradle file.

Developed By
============

Designed and developed by [Eric Kok](mailto:eric@2312.nl) of [2312 development](https://2312.nl/).
Contributions by various others (see commit log).
